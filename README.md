Built Sudoku using Claude Sonnet

Prompt 1 was building the grid and restricting the numbers
Prompt 2 was not restricting the numbers using javascript but not html, and TDD approach to checking if a row/column/block was valid
Prompt 3 was creating Sudoku Solver, again with TDD approach.
Prompt 4 was UI element changes like adding a class when a duplicate pair of numbers appear in a block/column/road and generating a starting board by randomly filling a board and then removing numbers and it still be solvable
